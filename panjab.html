                        The Golden Temple was founded by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in the 16th century. The temple
                         was built on a sacred tank called Amrit Sarovar, which means "Pool of Immortality." The temple is built 
                         in a four-tiered style, with the topmost tier being covered in gold. The temple is surrounded by a pool of 
                         water, which is considered sacred by Sikhs.

                        The Golden Temple is a place of worship for Sikhs from all over the world. It is also a popular tourist 
                        destination, with millions of visitors each year. The temple is open to people of all faiths and is a symbol of 
                        peace and brotherhood.
